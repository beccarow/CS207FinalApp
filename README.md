## Recyclables Classifier: About the app

The Recyclables Classifer app classifies images of objects as recyclable and not recyclable and directs users to the recyclable center nearest to the user's current location. This app utilizes the MobileNetV2 image classification model through Core ML as well as MapKit.


## Features

The user can upload an existing photo from their photo library or take a live capture photo and determine the subject's classification. The chosen image is displayed on a screen, and users are informed of the percent likelihood of the subject being recyclable or not. They are then given the choice to find a recycling center close by. Users are able to reupload and/or retake photos until they find they decide on one to classify by tapping the "Determine" button.
